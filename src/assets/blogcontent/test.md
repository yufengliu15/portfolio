# Test
Does this work???

## Aspectual properties of verb phrases
Time structure of events
- Telic vs Atelic                        (is there an endpoint?)
Telic is where there is an endpoint, atelic is no endpoint
- Durative vs instantaneous   (does the even unfold in time?)
Ex: writing and reading a book is durative, sneezing is instantaneous

|               | Telic           | Atelic     |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Durative      | Accomplishments | Activities |
| Instantaneous | Achievements    |            |

Accomplishments: Program
Activities: Laugh and dance
Achievements: Reach, notice, learn

Activities take *for* time adverbials; accomplishments take *in* time adverbials

"Subinterval property": activities describe events which are true at various subintervals, while accomplishments are only true at an endpoint.
- "Roberta was swimming" entails "Roberta has swum"
- "Roberta was building a house" does not entail "Roberta has built a house"

Accomplishments are ambiguous with *almost*; achievements are not

### Coefficient of $x$ and $y$
What is the coefficient of $x^{20}y^{35}$ in the expansion of $(5x - 3y)^{55}$ ?

${55 \choose 20}$ or $55 \choose 35$, both are the same thing

$5^{20} \cdot (-3)^{35}$ 

Thus, the coefficient is $-{55 \choose 35} \cdot 5^{20} \cdot 3^{35}$ 

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Markdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

const markdown = `
# Your markdown here
`

ReactDOM.render(
  <Markdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>{markdown}</Markdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```
